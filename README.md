Battery Management System (BMS)

### Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a Battery Management System (BMS) aimed at monitoring and managing battery for HVDC EV charging, to facilitate research testing different cell chemistries and configurations for optimized charging.

Objectives

	•	Develop a comprehensive BMS to monitor state-of-charge, balance of system, voltage, and temperature.
	•	Optimize battery-charging performance through intelligent state-of-charge estimation algorithms.
 	•	Implemented safety features to prevent overcharging, over-discharging, and overheating.

Key Responsibilities
	
System Design:
	•	Designed the architecture of the BMS, including hardware and software components.
	•	Selected appropriate sensors, components, and microcontrollers (and created BOM) for monitoring battery parameters from DigiKey based on project requirements.

Circuit Design:
	•	Developed on existing circuit designs using Altium Designer.
	•	Created PCB layouts, ensuring optimal component placement to facilitate easier battery configuration flexibility.
	
 •	Firmware Development:

	•	Implemented communication protocols (CAN) for data exchange between components.
	•	Fully reprogrammed BMS GUI/dashboard to facilitate researchers' different battery test configurations. 
	
 •	Testing & Debugging:
	•	Conducted extensive PCB and software testing to validate system performance and safety features.
	•	Utilized high-voltage oscilloscopes and multimeters to troubleshoot and optimize circuit designs.
	•	Logged all test results into extensive research documentation, and conducted thorough project handover for incoming intern.
	
 •	Data Analysis:
	•	Conducted battery-cycling data (using lab battery test equipment) from battery performance tests to improve algorithms for state of charge (SoC) estimations.
	•	Implemented live data logging for performance metrics using SQL.
